		<p>Remontoire is a small (~71Kb) GTK app for presenting keybinding hints in a compact form suitable for tiling window environments. It is intended for use with the i3 window manager but it's also able to display keybindings from any suitably formatted config file.</p>
		<p>The program functions by scanning and parsing comments in a specific format (described directly below), then displaying them in a one-layer categorized list view. The program stores the state of which sections are expanded, allowing for use on screens with limited resolution.</p>
